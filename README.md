How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The way this helps is by gathering requirements that are needed for the program. This lays out the foundation and overall gives you an idea of what it is that you plan on doing for it. Not only that but it also puts you in the shoes of understanding overall what the goals, pain points, and priorities will be for the program. It also gives you clarity on what it is that you will be doing.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaches that come to mind that I will use are gathering the requirements and using the 'User stories' like I was asked about in the previous question. Another thing that really comes to mind is just planning the overall structure of the program and designing it. Development is key as well, along with testing to make sure that the program is running efficiently with no errors. When it comes to agile processes that I hope to incorporate I choose Scrum since it's really helpful when it comes to teams as a whole.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills. I feel as though in order to be a good member of a software development team you must be an effective listener, have great communication with your team and express your ideas whatever they may be. You have to also be a team player and keep in mind what it is that everyone is saying, helping out the rest of the team with the project on a day-to-day basis and keeping track. You must be flexible too and think deeply about solving any problems that may come to light during the project. Along with taking initiative in certain areas, which I feel could be vital in certain points depending on the others that you're working with and just not being afraid to learn.
